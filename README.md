Based on cutting-edge wearable EEG technology, the Air Band uses the Muse headbandâ€™s infrastructure to gather data related to the frontal cortex of the brain. 
This data is then used to detect actions like a blink or a jaw clench--anything that causes even the most minute of variation in the electric signal pattern in the frontal cortex. 
Once this detection is complete, these signals can be used as controls for absolutely anything in any game--in this case shifting strings and adjusting loudness. 
The possibilities for growth and innovation are truly endless!

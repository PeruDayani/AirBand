<h3> AirBand: A EEG Video Game Controller </h3>

<p> 
For the SacHacks 24 hour hackathon we build a Unity API for the Muse EEG Headband to push accessibility in the video game industry. The Muse headband provides access to electrical signal patterns for the 5 common brainwaves in the frontal cortex of the brain. This data is then used to detect actions like a blink or a jaw clench--anything that causes even the most minute of variation in the electric signal pattern in the frontal cortex. Once this detection is complete, these signals can be used as controls for absolutely anything in any game. We build out a basic verision of guitar hero fully functional and playable using just a person's mind!
